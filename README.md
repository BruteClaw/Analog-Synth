Analog Synthasizer Designs

These are designs for EuroRack compatable synthasizer modules.

Each module is designed as a seperate project in KiCAD
Each folder includes a BOM from Mouser.com, the Gerber Files if you just want to have a board printed and a PDF of the schematic.

I have taken insparation from all over the web including Music From Outer Space, Yusynth and Look Mom no Computer.
Some designs are outright copies of their schematic with my board layout design.

Look in Overal Design.xlsx for where I have gotten the design from And current progress on the designs.

All designs are without waranty, please build at your own risk, I have not tested any of these designs at this time.
If you build any of them, you assume responsibiltiy for any potential damage to your existing equipment.
